This dataset is information on alternative-fuel stations. I am interested in predicting the location and quantity of new stations in the future.
I think that the most relevant column types are dates, state, ZIP code, and latitude and longitude.

!["Count by Year"](./Figure_1.png "Count by Year")


!["Count by Year"](./Figure_2.png "Count by Year")


Most of the columns dropped were either mostly empty or had no bearing on the metrics being considered.
State was hot-encoded because there are many states.
